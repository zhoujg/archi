    <h2>Jasper Reports</h2>
    
    <p><a href="https://www.jaspersoft.com/jasperreports" target="_blank">Jasper Reports</a> is the world's most popular Java reporting engine. Combine data sources and produce pixel-perfect documents that can be viewed, printed, or exported into a variety of document formats with this powerful reporting tool. Archi can export models in various formats using Jasper Reports Templates.</p>
    
    <p>This option is available from the "Report-&gt;Jasper..." menu item from the main "File" menu. Once a model is selected in the Model Tree or in a View this menu item is enabled. Provide the details in the following wizard page:</p>

    <br/>
    
    <p>And then in the next wizard page, choose the report template that you prefer:</p>

    <h2>Customisable Jasper Reports</h2>
    
    <p>If you choose the "Customizable Report" template when exporting, then you can set various properties for the report's layout if you base your model on the "Customizable Report" model template when creating a new model. See <a href="templates_new_model.html">"Creating a New Model from a Template"</a> for more details.</p>
    
    <p>If you wish to create your own custom Jasper Report templates you can place these in a folder named "reports" in the application preference folder, or select a template file from the "Choose..." combo option. For more information on creating custom Jasper Reports please refer to the developer section of the Archi website.</p>

    <h2>HTML Reports</h2>
    
    <p>Archi supports a basic reporting functionality by means of generating a single HTML page containing summary tables of the model elements and the Views in a model.</p>
    
    <p>This option is available from the "Report-&gt;HTML..." menu item from the main "File" menu. Once a model is selected in the Model Tree or in a View this menu item is enabled. Select a folder to export the model and its Views.</p>
    
    <p>A single HTML page, "report.html" is generated in the chosen output folder together with image files for the Views in the model.</p>
